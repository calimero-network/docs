# Examples

Calimero examples range from simple starter apps to complex multi-context applications. Learn by exploring working code and adapting patterns to your own projects.

## Core Apps Examples

**Start here**: [Core Apps Examples](core-apps-examples.md) — Reference implementations from `core/apps` that demonstrate SDK patterns and CRDT usage.

These examples live in the [`calimero-network/core/apps`](https://github.com/calimero-network/core/tree/master/apps) directory and include:

- **kv-store** - Basic CRDT operations
- **blobs** - File/blob management
- **collaborative-editor** - Text collaboration with RGA CRDT
- **private-data** - Private storage patterns
- **team-metrics** - Nested CRDT structures
- **xcall-example** - Cross-context communication

Each example includes source code, README, and Merobox workflow files for easy testing.

## Application Examples

- [Battleships](battleships.md) - Multiplayer game demonstrating real-time sync
- [Shared Todo Backlog](shared-todo-backlog.md) - CRDT patterns and UI workflows
- [Split Bills](split-bills.md) - Delegation and settlement flows
- [Additional Templates](additional-templates.md) - More examples and templates

## Overview

Examples are organized by complexity:

- **Starter**: Basic CRDT usage (kv-store, simple counters)
- **Intermediate**: Event handling, blob management, nested structures
- **Advanced**: Cross-context calls, complex state machines, multi-context apps

## Battleships

- One-liner summary.
- TODO: link to README anchors and add diagram.

## Shared Todo Backlog

- Highlight CRDT patterns and UI workflow.

## Split Bills

- Summarize delegation and settlement flows.

## Additional Templates

- KV Store, Demo Blob App, Calimero Curb Chat.
- Plan to add link list with status badges.
