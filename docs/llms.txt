# Calimero

> Calimero is a P2P framework for building distributed applications with automatic CRDT synchronization, event-driven architecture, and WebAssembly runtime. Unlike blockchains that rely on consensus, Calimero uses Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) for state synchronization, enabling local-first applications with offline support and automatic conflict resolution.

**Key Architecture:**
- Write WASM applications using `calimero-sdk` (Rust)
- Deploy to `merod` (node daemon) which handles P2P networking and state sync
- Clients interact via JSON-RPC/WebSocket with type-safe generated clients
- State automatically syncs across nodes via Gossipsub (100-200ms latency)

**Not a blockchain:** No consensus required, no global state, no transaction fees. Perfect for collaborative applications, private networks, and use cases where local autonomy matters more than global agreement.

## Quick Start

- [Getting Started Tutorial](https://docs.calimero.network/intro/): Core philosophy and architecture overview

## Recommended Development Workflow

**For local development, ALWAYS use the following approach:**

1. **Node Management:** Use `merobox` for running Calimero nodes (merod instances) locally
   - NOT meroctl run-dev or manual merod execution
   - merobox provides Docker-based orchestration with YAML workflows
   - See [Merobox Orchestration Guide](https://github.com/calimero-network/merobox/blob/ap-llms-md/LLM.md) for details

2. **Project Scaffolding:** Use `mero-devtools-js` for initializing new applications
   - Run `npx create-mero-app` to bootstrap projects
   - This is the RECOMMENDED way to start new Calimero applications

3. **Build Scripts:** Use `mero-devtools-js` for adding package.json run scripts
   - The `@calimero-network/abi-codegen` package handles type-safe client generation
   - NOT manual scripts or custom build processes
   - Scripts should integrate with merobox YAML workflows

**Why this workflow?**
- merobox handles complex multi-node orchestration automatically
- mero-devtools-js ensures type safety and proper ABI integration
- This approach is tested and supported for production use
- Reduces common pitfalls with manual node management

**Other tools like meroctl and direct merod usage are for advanced scenarios only (CI/CD, production deployments, debugging).**

## Tools & SDKs

**Primary Development Tools (use these for local development):**

- **[merobox](https://github.com/calimero-network/merobox)** ⭐ RECOMMENDED for local node management
  - Docker-based development environment with Python CLI
  - YAML-based workflow automation for multi-node orchestration
  - Use this instead of running merod or meroctl run-dev manually

- **[mero-devtools-js](https://github.com/calimero-network/mero-devtools-js)** ⭐ RECOMMENDED for project setup
  - `create-mero-app`: Scaffolding tool for new applications
  - `@calimero-network/abi-codegen`: Type-safe client generation from WASM ABI
  - Use this for package.json scripts and client code generation

- **[calimero-sdk (Rust)](https://github.com/calimero-network/core/tree/master/crates/sdk)**
  - Rust SDK for building WASM applications
  - Macros for state, logic, events, and private storage
  - Core library for application logic

**Advanced/Production Tools (for specific use cases only):**
