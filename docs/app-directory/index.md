# App Directory

The App Directory showcases existing **Calimero applications** that you can deploy or integrate quickly.

## Getting Started

You can browse available apps directly from the **Calimero Application Registry**:

To get started:

1. Clone or download an app from the registry.
2. Follow the README inside each app for setup instructions.
3. Run it within your Calimero environment to test and customize.

More detailed guides and configuration examples will be added here soon.
