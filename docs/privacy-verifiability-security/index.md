# Privacy, Verifiability & Security

Calimero integrates with blockchain infrastructure — not to perform computation, but to provide a **source of truth** for:

- Network membership (list of participants)
- Roles and permissions
- Verifiable state checkpoints

In this modular stack:

- Calimero handles **data collaboration and replication**.
- The blockchain layer provides **immutability and verification**.
- Other tools like **zero-knowledge proofs (ZK)** can extend privacy guarantees.

Calimero is a component of a broader **privacy-oriented architecture** — modular, composable, and adaptable to your needs.
